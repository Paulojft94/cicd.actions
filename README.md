# cicd.actions

Experiment with CI/CD pipeline development using GitHub Actions, with a special focus on automated testing, artifact management, code analysis and etc.

## Goals

Build, Test, and Deploy:Develop a sample application and set up GitHub Actions workflows to automatically build the app, run various tests (unit, integration, functional), and deploy to test or production environments.

### Artifact Management

Create, store, and enable the download of artifacts such as deployment packages, binaries, and test logs for further analysis.

### Real-Time Monitoring and Reporting

Implement monitoring tools and notifications to quickly identify and resolve issues, along with generating detailed reports on pipeline performance and code quality.


##### Outcomes

Enhanced Code Quality:Early detection of errors through automated testing improves overall code integrity.
